# Art Inventory

This repository contains the source code for a RESTful backend server designed to manage an art inventory system.

The server is built with Node.js and Express, and it interacts with a PostgreSQL database for storing and retrieving artwork-related data.

You will need a PostgreSQL instance running on your local machine to get started.

This projet follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, this ensures a clean separation of concerts between routes, business logic and the database interaction.
